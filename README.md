# consumer-classifier
A K-means algorithm as well as a clustering algorithm were used to classify consumers into groups. 
These groups were then visualized and interpreted into different classes of income and financial literacy. 
There are many applications of a classifier like this such as a behavioral study into which kind of consumers tend toward certain behaviors, or perhaps selling particular financial products to an individual based on their classification.
